## Executive Summary

NarrativeSync explores how minimal declarative inputs can be used to generate dynamic, interactive storytelling agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Using Prompy, a minimal prompt specification format, users can describe an interactive story agent in just a few lines. The output is a fully functional Python script that narrates a branching narrative aloud using text-to-speech and responds to user choices.
