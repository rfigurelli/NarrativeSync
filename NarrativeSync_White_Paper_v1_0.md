# NarrativeSync: Combine Storytelling with Prompy and Executable Logic

**White Paper v1.0.0**

## Executive Summary

NarrativeSync explores how minimal declarative inputs can be used to generate dynamic, interactive storytelling agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Using Prompy, a minimal prompt specification format, users can describe an interactive story agent in just a few lines. The output is a fully functional Python script that narrates a branching narrative aloud using text-to-speech and responds to user choices.

## 1. Introduction

Interactive storytelling has traditionally required specialized engines, domain-specific languages, or manual scripting. These barriers limit creative experimentation and rapid deployment. NarrativeSync demonstrates a new paradigm where LLMs generate complete story engines from compact descriptions, using Prompy to structure intent and isolate configuration from implementation.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Creating branching narratives typically involves:

* Familiarity with interactive fiction platforms
* Manual logic design and scripting
* Integration of media and user input handling

These technical burdens hinder accessibility. We propose that narrative logic and execution can be automated through generative code pipelines driven by simple task prompts.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

NarrativeSync defines a system where:

* A user writes a `.prompy` file describing the agent and task
* Prompy converts this into a detailed natural language prompt
* An LLM interprets the prompt to produce a working Python script

The script:

* Narrates the story using pyttsx3 (TTS)
* Waits for user input at key decision points
* Dynamically shifts story branches based on decisions

## 4. End-to-End Example

Below is a complete sequence showing the Prompy specification, the generated prompt, and the resulting Python script, all derived from the same task.

### .prompy Specification

```prompy
agent: StoryBot
task: Write and narrate a short sci-fi story with dynamic choices
```

### Prompt Generated by Prompy

```text
Create a Python script named "StoryBot". It should:

- Tell a short, original science fiction story.
- Ask the user to make choices that influence the direction of the story.
- Include at least two decision points with multiple outcomes.
- Use the pyttsx3 text-to-speech library to narrate each part of the story aloud.
```

### Python Script Generated

```python
import pyttsx3

# Initialize text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def narrate(text):
    print(text)
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Start the story
narrate("You are Captain Nova, on a solo mission to explore the edge of the galaxy.")
narrate("You encounter a derelict alien spacecraft drifting silently.")

choice1 = input("Do you (1) board the alien ship or (2) report it to HQ? ")

if choice1 == "1":
    narrate("You board the ship. Inside, strange symbols glow on the walls.")
    narrate("Suddenly, the doors close behind you.")

    choice2 = input("Do you (1) activate the control panel or (2) look for an escape route? ")

    if choice2 == "1":
        narrate("The ship powers up and jumps to a distant star system. You are now its pilot.")
    else:
        narrate("You find a manual release and return safely, but the mystery remains unsolved.")

else:
    narrate("You report back to HQ. A science team is dispatched.")
    narrate("However, by the time they arrive, the ship has vanished.")

    choice2 = input("Do you (1) pursue the ship’s last known trajectory or (2) return to Earth? ")

    if choice2 == "1":
        narrate("You follow the trail and discover an ancient alien archive full of knowledge.")
    else:
        narrate("You head home, wondering what secrets the universe still holds.")

narrate("End of story.")
```

## 7. Use Cases

* **Education**: Interactive learning narratives in science, ethics, or history
* **Entertainment**: Audio-based mini-games or story-driven voice apps
* **Accessibility**: Audio interfaces for narrative content

---

## 8. Future Extensions

* Integration with GUI or voice input
* Export to HTML or chatbot formats
* Procedural generation of stories from external inputs
